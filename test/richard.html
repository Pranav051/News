        <h3>In first private spaceflight, Richard Branson flies to edge and back</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>British billionaire Richard Branson on Sunday soared more than 50 miles above the New Mexico desert 
           aboard his Virgin Galactic rocket plane and safely returned in the vehicle’s first fully crewed test 
           flight to space, a symbolic milestone for a venture he started 17 years ago.</p><br>
        <p>Branson, one of six Virgin Galactic Holding Inc employees strapped in for the ride, has touted the 
           mission as a precursor to a new era of space tourism, with the company he founded in 2004 poised to 
           begin commercial operations next year.</p><br>
        <p>The success of the flight also gave the flamboyant entrepreneur bragging rights in a highly 
           publicised rivalry with fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, the Amazon online retail mogul who had hoped 
           to fly into space first aboard his own space company’s rocket.</p>
