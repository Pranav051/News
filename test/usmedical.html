        <p>The United States, which has been grappling with a rising number of Covid-19 cases as the Delta 
           variant wreaks havoc, now has a new problem at hand â€” that of oxygen scarcity.
           Hospitals in parts of the South are running out of oxygen supply as Covid-19 cases and 
           hospitalizations continue soaring, driven by the swaths of people who remain unvaccinated and a 
           dangerous coronavirus variant that has infected millions of Americans.</p><br>
        <p>Several hospitals in Florida, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana are struggling with oxygen 
           scarcity. Some are at risk of having to use their reserve supply or risk running out of oxygen 
           imminently, according to state health officials and hospital consultants.</p><br>
        <p>Florida on Saturday had the highest Covid-19 hospitalization rate in the country, with 75 patients 
           per 100,000 residents in hospitals with the virus, according to data from federal health officials 
           and Johns Hopkins University. It also reached yet another pandemic high of Covid-19 cases Friday, 
           reporting 690.5 new cases per 100,000 people each day from August 20 to August 26, state data showed.</p>
