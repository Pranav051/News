        <h3>No vaccine to provide protection indefinitely, everyone will need booster shots</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>Amid uncertainty over the use of vaccine boosters against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), 
           top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said no vaccines that are in use in the 
           United States are going to provide an indefinite amount of protection. Appearing for NBC’s ‘Today’ 
           show, Fauci revealed that booster shots will be recommended “imminently” for fully vaccinated 
           people with weakened immune systems.</p><br>
        <p>While the 80-year-old immunologist said the United States is not going to administer booster shots 
           in coming days to people other than those who are immuno-compromised, he acknowledged that 
           “inevitably there will be a time when we'll have to get boosts” since “no vaccine, at least 
           not within this category, is going to have an indefinite amount of protection.”</p><br>
        <p>Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a moratorium on booster shots 
           until at least the end of September to enable all countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their 
           population. Highlighting the vaccine disparity, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus 
           said low-income countries have only been able to administer 1.5 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine 
           for every 100 people.</p>
