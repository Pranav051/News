        Samsung has expanded its partnership with Microsoft to provide a better user experience on the newly launched Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3.
        As a result of the new move, Microsoft Office, Teams, and Outlook on the foldable phones will come with new productivity features. Samsung has also continued its collaboration with American designer Thom Browne to launch special editions of the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic models in some markets. 
        Separately, the company has silently ditched the in-box charger with the regular Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 units in markets including the US. The charger is, however, bundled in China.
        Microsoft announced the expansion of its partnership with Samsung through a blog post published following the Galaxy Unpacked event. The Redmond company said that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 will get new experiences on Microsoft Office, Teams, and Outlook.
