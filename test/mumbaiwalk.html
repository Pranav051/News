        <h3>Mumbai needs to encourage the walk-to-work culture. Here’s why</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>The concept of walk-to-work, where housing, workplaces, and shopping centres are in the vicinity of 
           each other, is fast becoming popular in major cities. For a city like Mumbai, where so many people 
           spend hours commuting to work, this ‘one change’ would make a huge difference.</p><br>
        <p>Honking, traffic snarls, and high stress levels — this is exactly what commuting to work looks like 
           for most Indian professionals, especially those living in metro cities. There are several reasons 
           that contribute to this mess: growing population, socio-economic parameters, poor road 
           infrastructure, and a weak transport network.</p><br>
        <p>There are several solutions to address this issue, one of them being the introduction of a 
           ‘walk-to-work’ culture. What this means is that residences are not too far from commercial spaces. 
           Office-goers, therefore, save time, money, and energy spent on commuting, and can focus on 
           improving the quality of their lives.</p>
