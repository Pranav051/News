        <h3>Microsoft Is Reportedly Discontinuing Support for Office Apps on Chromebook From September 18</h3>
        <img src = "img/microsoft.jpg" alt = ""  height="500" >
        <p>Microsoft is reportedly discontinuing support for its Office apps on Chromebook. 
           A new report states that the company wants Chromebook users to transition to Web versions of these apps.
           This decision will be incorporated in mid-September and while the apps will not be supported by 
           Microsoft anymore they will continue to function. 
           Chromebook users can download Microsoft's Office apps from the Google Play store and use all their features, 
           though the Web experience with Microsoft 365 service provides more functionality.</p>
        <p>According to an email statement cited by TechCrunch, Microsoft stated that starting September 18, 
           Microsoft apps will be transitioned to Web experiences for Chromebook users. 
           This means after September 18, Microsoft will stop supporting Office apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, 
           OneNote, and Outlook, so they will not be updated or optimised further. 
           Instead, Microsoft wants Chromebook users to switch to the Web versions of these apps for 
           “the most optimised experience”.</p>
        <p>The statement reportedly reads, “In an effort to provide the most optimised experience for 
           Chromebook customers, Microsoft apps (Office and Outlook) will be transitioned to web experiences 
           (Office.com and Outlook.com) on September 18, 2021”.</p>
