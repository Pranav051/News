        <h3>Taliban affiliate Al Qaeda calls for liberation of Kashmir as global jihad</h3>
        <br><br>
        <img src = "img/al.png" alt = ""  height="500" >
        <br><br>
        <p>The Al Qaeda statement came on the day the senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Stanakzai assured 
           the Indian envoy to Qatar that no anti-India activity would be allowed in Afghanistan.</p><br>
        <p>The Narendra Modi government has noted with concern the statement issued by Taliban affiliate 
           Al Qaeda on Tuesday praising the Sunni Pashtun US-designated terrorist group for humiliating and 
           defeating American forces and then expelling them from Afghanistan and virtually exhorting the 
           Islamist forces to launch global jihad to liberate Palestine, Islamic Magreb, Somalia, Yemen and 
           Kashmir from the enemies of Islam. The Al Qaeda statement came on the day the senior Taliban leader 
           Sher Mohammed Stanakzai assured the Indian envoy to Qatar that no anti-India activity would be 
           allowed in Afghanistan.</p><br>
        <p>While US President Joe Biden claimed victory in Afghanistan after what he called decimating of 
           Al Qaeda and killing of their leader Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda statement shows the group is 
           alive and kicking in Afghanistan as it sought the allegiance of Taliban supreme leader Mullah 
           Hibatullah Akundzada and previous two Ameer-ul-Momeen of the Islamist group including Mullah Omar. 
           Just as the Taliban have never raised the issue of Kashmir, they have also never criticised the 
           Al Qaeda group. The statement reveals that the so-called liberation of Afghanistan was the first step 
           and a precursor to global jihad by the Islamist group. It is quite evident that the capture of Kabul 
           by the Taliban has made the group a rallying point for all jihadists in the world.</p>
