        <h3>Twitter's New Retweet With Comment Counter Is Now Available On Andriod & Web</h3>
        <img src = "img/twitter.png" alt = ""  height="500" >
        <p>Last week, Twitter rolled out a new feature to iOS, 
        where you can see the number of times your tweet has been retweeted with a comment, 
        now it is available on Android and iOS.</p>
        <p>This isn’t a huge feature, but it can be pretty useful to some people. 
        Now you’re going to be able to see how many people retweeted your tweet and added a comment. 
        This previously did not show up under the retweet number. 
        And was sometimes a bit difficult to actually find in your mentions.</p>
        <p>With this new feature, when you click on the retweet number under your tweet, 
        you’ll be able to see who retweeted it and who retweeted it with a comment. 
        As it now shows in two tabs on that page. It shows you the tweet too, 
        so if you want to reply to their retweet of yours, then you can do so from right there. 
        Which makes things super easier.</p>
